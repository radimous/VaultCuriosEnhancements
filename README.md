# VaultCuriosEnhancements
Makes vault curios shift-clickable, adds vault compass and shard pouch curio and makes the junk identifier usable in any curio <br>
Mostly server-side mod<br>
Clients without the mod won't see proper curio slot names and they won't be able to buy items from black market when they have shard pouch in curio slot<br>
