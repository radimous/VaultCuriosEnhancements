# VaultCuriosEnhancements
Makes vault curios shift-clickable, adds vault compass and shard pouch curio and makes the junk identifier usable in any curio.  
Both server and client should have this mod installed, but it is optional on both sides and you can connect to servers without the mod and vice versa.  
Can display number of available shards in black market (must be enabled in config).

If it's only on the server:  
- Clients without the mod won't see proper curio slot names (but they can still use the curios)  
- Clients without the mod won't be able to buy items from black market when they have shard pouch in curio slot
- Can't enable black market shard count display  

If it's only on the client:
- Can only enable black market shard count display, everything else is server-side
