# VaultCuriosEnhancements  
Both server and client should have this mod installed for the best experience, but it is optional on both sides, so you can connect to servers without the mod and vice versa.  
More details in each section.  

### New curios:
- Vault Compass

- Void Stone
- Coin Pouch

To enable the compass curio you must open invhud settings with keybind (O by default, [opening it from config menu won't work](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-hud-forge/issues/99)), and enable it in the curio tab.
